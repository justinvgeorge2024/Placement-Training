Memory Space:
RAM handles storage and processing. 
ROM is made for storage purposes

for the same unit space, ROM will have higher storage capacity than RAM.

Something stored in ROM will not be stored in a specific location, whereas in RAM it is stored in a specific location.
memory in RAM consits of Stack, Heap and COde section.

Array- static allocation
An array a[10] is a single consequtive memory block
In C Program, you can access undeclared memory space.
------
types of array declaration in c
int a1[10];
int a2[]={1,2,3};

int size =4;
scanf("%d",&size);  // put in hold.
int a4[size]; // put in hold but the program will work since there is no assignment operation.
int a5[size] ={1,2,3}; //will not work since there is an assignment, but size of array is given in a dynamic declaration
//int a3[];

--------------
INITIALIZATION
--------------
--------------
3 types of values attained in a array memory.
1} garbage value
2} zero
3} assigned value

 int a[100]; will have zero or garbage value.
 int a[100] ={1,2}; // a[0] =1, a[1] =2 , rest autoinitialized to 0
